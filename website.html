        For good or for bad, our leaders can be powerful forces for change in the world. The most influential leaders 
        (those who changed the face of world politics and forever altered their own countries) weren't necessarily 
        good leaders. Some famous conquerors changed the world but let destruction in their wake. Others actually 
        worked for the good of their people and became the great leaders in history. Across the globe, leaders are 
        facing extraordinary uncertainty. Unprecedented challenges resulting from the pandemic are forcing leaders 
        to tackle remote work and learning. Simultaneously, leaders must address long-overdue racial and social 
        injustices inside the workplace. Despite these challenging issues, you may consider yourself lucky to work 
        with someone who truly understands what it means to be an effective leader. This is what they are probably 
        doing right:

        Great leaders are constant, genuine and curious learners.
                            
        Never complacent in their pursuit of knowledge, strong leaders always seek to learn more. They recognize 
        that learning is a lifelong endeavor; they find joy and energy in learning about new people and concepts. 
        Their authentic curiosity leads not only to a better understanding of the business they lead, but also to a 
        better relationship with their team.

        Concerning the art of diplomacy, a diplomat is defined as a person appointed by a state(monarchy/republic) or 
        an intergovernmental institution (such as the United Nations or the European Union) to conduct diplomacy 
        with one or more other states or international organizations. E.g. Charles Maurice de Tallyrand Périgord.

        Before we define a military commander, we must first establish what is military strategy. Military strategy 
        is the planning and execution of the contest between groups of armed adversaries. Strategy, which is a 
        subdiscipline of warfare and of foreign policy, is a principal tool to secure national interests. A military 
        commander/strategist is the person at the top brass of the hierarchy that takes plans and implements said 
        strategies in the interests of his or her state with and is motivated to maximize the losses of the adversary 
        while minimizing his own. E.g. Sun Tzu.

          <figcaption><strong>Socrates (470-399 BC), Athenian philosopher and founder of Western Philosophy</strong> engaged in his dialogue with 
            another, regarding the ideal qualities of a true statesman, showcased in Plato's Statesman dialogue.

      <p class="statesman-desription">
        The ideal statesman, as written by Plato in his socratic dialogue - The Statesman, otherwise known as 
        Politicus in Latin, is conceptually a philosopher-king i.e. a true statesman must be a philsopher. According to 
        Plato, a philosopher is someone who seeks wisdom and understanding of the world and is able to think critically 
        and objectively. Thus, the statesman, as a philosopher, is able to use this wisdom and understandin to govern 
        justly and in the people's interests. Additionally, Plato argued that the statesman must be able to discern 
        different kinds of rulers - tyrants, demagogues and true statesmen, from one another.
        Tyrants and demagogues, Plato believed, were harmful to society as they pursued their selfish interests at the 
        expense of the common good, whereas true statesmen were able to put the needs of the people above their own. 
        Moreover, Plato stated that the statesman should also be knowledgeable about the arts and sciences, and should 
        be able to apply this knowledge in the service of the state, arguing that statesmen should be well-rounded and 
        well-educated in order to be able to make informed and wise decisions. Also, Plato believed in the concept of
        "the noble lie", which, he argued, was necessary in order to maintain social cohesion and stability. It was a 
        belief that was held by the ruling class in order to maintain social harmony and to prevent social unrest.

        A person, who serves as a representative or an ambassador on behalf of the government of a particular country, may be

        and tactfulness in dealing with matters concerning national and international politics which is setting of high stakes

        The commanding officer (CO) or commander, or sometimes, if the incumbent is a general officer, commanding general (CG) or 
        general officer commanding (GOC), is the officer in command of a military unit.
        If the challenges of human life and technological change are essentially similar in ancient and modern societies, what 
        might be learned from ancient cultures about what it takes to be a great leader are two sets of factors that are relevant 
        to the emergence of such leaders - 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Traits of personality and character that permit the great commander to comprehend his world 
              as it is, even as he sees beyond it to the objectives he wishes to advance in the future.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Historical circumstance in which the commander finds himself.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Grave social and military crises create opportunities for leaders to arise who might otherwise have lived completely 
        ordinary and unrecorded lives. The connection between crises and the emergence of great leaders is often impossible to 
        discern at the time, being revealed only through the hindsight of history.
        The greatest commanders of ancient and modern times shared the following similaririties:
        <ul>
          <li><i>Experiencing War at an Early Age</i></li>
          <li><i>Formal Education and Sharp Intellect</i></li>
          <li><i>The Creativity of an Open Mind</i></li>
          <li><i>Self-Confidence</i></li>
